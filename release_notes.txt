  GOAL: Improve usability
  @gui
  [ ] Add a link to the user documentation to the plain empty starting page
  [ ] In the diagram overview of a newly initialized database, show some help messages
  [ ] Beautify layer backgrounds - e.g. light-blue sky in root-diagram
  [ ] In new-object and new-diagram modes, draw a warning-symbol below the cursor
  [ ] in overview mode, limit the number of visible children and add scroll arrows (to be tested)
  [ ] in overview mode, add brothers and sister diagrams (and maybe aunts and uncles)
  [ ] in overview mode, allow to shift diagrams vertically
  [ ] in overview mode, allow to move diagrams horizontally
  [ ] reset-selection shall select everything if nothing is selected
  [ ] the type-dropdown box shall appear over the window - without this nasty scrolling
  @gui+ctrl
  [ ] When undoing/redoing things, switch to a diagram where you see the changes
  @pencil
  [ ] In COMMENTS/notes, show not the title but the description
