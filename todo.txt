ideas for future versions:
  @gui
  [*] paste: Allow to paste relationships
  [*] paste: Keep structure of diagrams and contained elements when pasting objects
  [ ] performance optimization: redraw only when shown(=visible) items have changed.
  [ ] a very long description shall not resize the window. (maybe scrollbars, maybe smaller font size, ...)
  [ ] a "saveAs" or export-as-cfu1 command should allow to copy the current db
  [ ] clicking into the current diagram in navigation view shall zoom to edit mode; duplicate eye button to get back
  [ ] the type drop down box needs icons to faster find the right type
  [ ] next to the about button, a help button is needed hat can provide context-sensitive information.
  [ ] rename relation ship types so that "source"-"rel-type-name"-"destination" is a correct sentence, see e.g. Realization/Generalization
  [ ] while dragging, show the grid lines to better explain the drag-result
  [ ] gui_sketch_card_get_highest_list_order should take into account only features that are displayed in a list, not e.g. ports
  @gui+ctrl
  [ ] When undoing/redoing things, switch to a diagram where you see the changes
  @pencil
  [ ] Support Diagram-Types: Profile
  [ ] exception+error flows to leave an interruptable area (activity diagrams)
  [ ] activity bars on lifelines missing
  [ ] feature compartments in use-cases look ugly
  [ ] more relationship types needed: undirected ---- and one-way x--> and no x--x dependency
  [ ] more relationship types needed: undirected ---- and one-way x--> and no x--x association
  [ ] more relationship types needed: undirected ---- communication-path
  [ ] sequence diagrams need if/loop-boxes
  [*] improve layouting of containments, e.g. consider labels, arrows and more gap-space
  [*] calculate a default classifier size based on the grid-distances
  [*] less overlaps of relationship-arrows
  @io
  [ ] export formats: extend export formats by latex, doxygen, asciidoc, rtf(?), pdf
  [ ] how to exclude diagrams from export? some are unimportant and exist just for completeness
  [ ] make the docbook and xhtml export formats more flexible to change the style, e.g. css
  @data
  [ ] some diagrams exist for completeness only - but do not contain important information. These shall be greyed out.
  [ ] performance optimization: possibly the feature and relationship filter on a visible_set is slow?
  @ctrl
  [ ] export XMI format
  [ ] import XMI format
  @utf8stringbuf
  [ ] combine the static string allocation with dynamic additional buffers for long strings
      maybe use memory arenas of glibc (?)
  @main
  [*] for export via command line: select file types to export
  @ts_log/trace/test_fw
  [ ] add or replace the int and %d printf stuff by uint64_t and PRIu64 macros
