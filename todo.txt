ideas for future versions:
  @gui
  [ ] paste: Allow to paste relationships
  [ ] paste: Keep structure of diagrams and contained elements when pasting objects
  [ ] performance optimization: redraw only when shown(=visible) items have changed.
  [ ] a very long description shall not resize the window. (maybe scrollbars, maybe smaller font size, ...)
  [ ] a "saveAs" or export-as-cfu1 command should allow to copy the current db
  [ ] clicking into the current diagram in navigation view shall zoom to edit mode; duplicate eye button to get back
  [ ] the type drop down box needs icons to faster find the right type
  [ ] next to the about button, a help button is needed hat can provide context-sensitive information.
  [ ] rename relation ship types so that "source"-"rel-type-name"-"destination" is a correct sentence, see e.g. Realization/Generalization
  [ ] while dragging, show the grid lines to better explain the drag-result
  @gui+ctrl
  [ ] When undoing/redoing things, switch to a diagram where you see the changes
  @pencil
  [ ] Support Diagram-Types: Profile
  [ ] exception+error flows to leave an interruptable area (activity diagrams)
  [ ] activity bars on lifelines missing
  [ ] hide all features (except lifelines) in scenario-based and list diagrams; prevent selection, creation etc.
  [ ] hide some relationships in scenario-based and list diagrams; prevent selection, creation etc.
  [ ] feature compartments in use-cases look ugly
  [ ] more relationship types needed: undirected ---- and one-way x--> and no x--x dependency
  [ ] more relationship types needed: undirected ---- and one-way x--> and no x--x association
  [ ] more relationship types needed: undirected ---- communication-path
  [ ] sequence diagram needs if/loop-boxes
  @io
  [ ] export formats: extend export formats by latex, doxygen, asciidoc, rtf(?), pdf
  [ ] suppress exporting descriptions of hidden relationships and features
  [ ] how to exclude diagrams from export? some are unimportant and exist just for completeness
  @data
  [ ] nodes and artifacts can either be concepts or anonymous instances. named-instances are not yet supported.
  [ ] some diagrams exist for completeness only - but do not contain important information. These shall be greyed out.
  @ctrl
  [ ] export XMI format
  [ ] import XMI format
  @utf8stringbuf
  [ ] combine the static string allocation with dynamic additional buffers for long strings
  @main
  [ ] remove the -f option again - db formats shall be converted automatically
  @ts_log/trace/test_fw
  [ ] add or replace the int and %d printf stuff by uint64_t and PRIu64 macros
