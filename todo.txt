ideas for future versions:
  @gui
  [ ] in overview mode, add brothers and sister diagrams (and maybe aunts and uncles)
  [ ] in overview mode, allow to shift diagrams vertically
  [ ] in overview mode, allow to move diagrams horizontally
  [ ] the type-dropdown box shall appear over the window - without scrolling
  [ ] paste: Allow to paste relationships
  [ ] paste: Keep structure of diagrams and contained elements when pasting objects
  [ ] lock classifiers: It shall be possible to lock classifiers so that they are not moved accidentially in many diagrams.
  [ ] performance optimization: redraw only when shown items have changed.
  @gui+ctrl
  [ ] When undoing/redoing things, switch to a diagram where you see the changes
  @pencil
  [ ] Support Diagram-Types: List, Sequence, Timing, Profile, Parametric, Interaction-Overview
  [ ] include and extends relationships shall show their stereotype
  @data
  [ ] more relationship types needed: requirements have derive and refine relations
  [ ] support ports for blocks and components
  @ctrl
