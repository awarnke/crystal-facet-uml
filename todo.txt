ideas for future versions:
  @gui
  [ ] performance optimization: redraw only when shown(=visible) items have changed;
      do not redraw 3 times when changing 3 attributes simultaneously. (especially at undo/redo)
  [ ] a "saveAs" or export-as-cfu1 command should allow to copy the current db
  [ ] next to the about button, a help button is needed that can provide context-sensitive information.
  [ ] when opening the second database, the root diagram cannot be focused immediately
  [ ] show a progress bar while exporting diagrams
  [ ] update seach result view when changing the database (e.g. by undo)
  @gui+ctrl
  [ ] When undoing/redoing things, switch to a diagram where you see the changes
  @pencil
  [ ] Support Diagram-Types: Profile
  [ ] exception+error flows to leave an interruptable area (activity diagrams)
  [ ] activity bars on lifelines missing
  [ ] feature compartments in use-cases look ugly
  [ ] more relationship types needed: undirected ---- and one-way x--> and no x--x dependency (non-navigateable ends)
  [ ] more relationship types needed: undirected ---- and one-way x--> and no x--x association
  [ ] more relationship types needed: undirected ---- communication-path
  [ ] sequence diagrams need if/loop-boxes
  [ ] activity diagrams need swimlanes/partitions
  [ ] component and artifact icons steal space from the "inner space" of the element
  @io
  [ ] export formats: enhance xmi standard compliance
  [ ] how to exclude diagrams from export? some are unimportant and exist just for completeness
  [ ] import XMI format
  @data
  [ ] some diagrams exist for completeness only - but do not contain important information. These shall be greyed out.
      --> add a "display_flags" field to "diagrams"
  [ ] performance optimization: possibly the feature and relationship filter on a visible_set is slow?
  [ ] diagrams need some kind of classification/stereotype like idea-for-future, rejected-alternative, ...
      --> add a "stereotype" field to "diagrams"
  [ ] some way to compare two database files / and/or to merge
  @ctrl
  @universal+utf8stringbuf
  [ ] combine the static string allocation with dynamic additional buffers for unexpectedly-long strings
  [ ] combine the static array allocation with dynamic additional buffers for arrays of unpredictable lengths
  [ ] add streaming support, e.g. to escape characters while writing to a file or to parse json before having received all data
  @main
  @ts_log/trace/test_fw

ANALYSIS-STATUS: Was reproducible with one build binary, not reproducable anymore after rebuild. Possibly inconsistent image?
ANALYSIS-STATUS: Code review of gui_file_export_dialog and gui_simple_message_to_user did not reveal flaws in memory.
