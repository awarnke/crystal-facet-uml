ideas for future versions:
  @gui
  [ ] paste: Allow to paste relationships
  [ ] paste: Keep structure of diagrams and contained elements when pasting objects
  [ ] lock classifiers: It shall be possible to lock classifiers so that they are not moved accidentially in many diagrams.
  [ ] performance optimization: redraw only when shown(=visible) items have changed.
  [ ] export formats: extend export formats by docbook, latex, doxygen, markdown
  [ ] improve lifeline handling in communication diagrams - a user need not see the existance of lifeline objects
  @gui+ctrl
  [ ] When undoing/redoing things, switch to a diagram where you see the changes
  @pencil
  [ ] Support Diagram-Types: Profile, Parametric, Interaction-Overview
  [ ] include and extends relationships shall show their stereotype
  [ ] show interfaces in deployment diagrams as circles (maybe every classifier has a minimized view?)
  @data
  [ ] more relationship types needed: requirements have derive and refine relations
  [ ] more classifier types needed: start-activity, decision-activity, end-activity, history-state
  [ ] more classifier types needed: equation (to be checked, see parametric diagram)
  @ctrl
  [ ] export XMI format
  [ ] import XMI format
  @utf8stringbuf
  [ ] combine the static string allocation with dynamic additional buffers for long strings
  @main
  [ ] remove the -f option again - db formats shall be converted automatically
