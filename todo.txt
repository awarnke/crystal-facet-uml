ideas for future versions:
  @gui
  [ ] in overview mode, limit the number of visible children and add scroll arrows (to be tested)
  [ ] in overview mode, add brothers and sister diagrams (and maybe aunts and uncles)
  [ ] in overview mode, allow to shift diagrams vertically
  [ ] in overview mode, allow to move diagrams horizontally
  [ ] the type-dropdown box shall appear over the window - without this nasty scrolling
  [ ] paste: Allow to paste relationships
  [ ] paste: Keep structure of diagrams and contained elements when pasting objects
  @gui+ctrl
  [ ] When undoing/redoing things, switch to a diagram where you see the changes
  @pencil
  [ ] In COMMENTS/notes, show not the title but the description
  [ ] Support Diagram-Types: List, Sequence, Timing, Profile
  [ ] Beautify relations where source and destination is identical
