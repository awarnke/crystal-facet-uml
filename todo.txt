ideas for future versions:
  @gui
  [ ] paste: Allow to paste relationships
  [ ] paste: Keep structure of diagrams and contained elements when pasting objects
  [?] lock classifiers: It shall be possible to lock classifiers so that they are not moved accidentially in many diagrams.
  [ ] performance optimization: redraw only when shown(=visible) items have changed.
  [ ] a very long description shall not resize the window. (maybe scrollbars, maybe smaller font size, ...)
  [ ] a "saveAs" or export-as-cfu1 command should allow to copy the current db
  [ ] clicking into the current diagram in navigation view shall zoom to edit mode; duplicate eye button to get back
  [ ] the type drop down box needs icons to faster find the right type
  [ ] next to the about button, a help button is needed hat can provide context-sensitive information.
  @gui+ctrl
  [ ] When undoing/redoing things, switch to a diagram where you see the changes
  @pencil
  [ ] Support Diagram-Types: Profile
  [ ] exception+error flows to leave an interruptable area (activity diagrams)
  [ ] activity bars on lifelines missing
  [ ] hide all features (except lifelines) in scenario-based and list diagrams; prevent selection, creation etc.
  [ ] hide some relationships in scenario-based and list diagrams; prevent selection, creation etc.
  [ ] ! feature compartments in use-cases look ugly
  @io
  [ ] export formats: extend export formats by latex, doxygen, asciidoc, rtf(?), pdf
  [ ] suppress exporting descriptions of hidden relationships and features
  [ ] how to exclude diagrams from export? some are unimportant and exist just for completeness
  @data
  [ ] nodes and artifacts can either be concepts or anonymous instances. named-instances are not yet supported.
  [ ] some diagrams exist for completeness only - but do not contain important information. These shall be greyed out.
  @ctrl
  [ ] export XMI format
  [ ] import XMI format
  @utf8stringbuf
  [ ] combine the static string allocation with dynamic additional buffers for long strings
  @main
  [ ] remove the -f option again - db formats shall be converted automatically
