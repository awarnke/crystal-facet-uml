ideas for future versions:
  @gui
  [ ] paste: Allow to paste relationships
  [ ] paste: Keep structure of diagrams and contained elements when pasting objects
  [ ] lock classifiers: It shall be possible to lock classifiers so that they are not moved accidentially in many diagrams.
  [ ] performance optimization: redraw only when shown(=visible) items have changed.
  [ ] export formats: extend export formats by docbook, latex, doxygen, asciidoc
  [ ] a very long description shall not resize the window. (maybe scrollbars, maybe smaller font size, ...)
  @gui+ctrl
  [ ] When undoing/redoing things, switch to a diagram where you see the changes
  @pencil
  [ ] Support Diagram-Types: Profile
  [ ] function call to self (timing and sequence diagrams) looks ugly
  [ ] exception+error flows to leave an interruptable area (activity diagrams)
  @data
  [.] more classifier types needed: start-activity, decision-activity, end-activity, history-state
  @ctrl
  [ ] export XMI format
  [ ] import XMI format
  @utf8stringbuf
  [ ] combine the static string allocation with dynamic additional buffers for long strings
  [ ] remove the warnings from the opensuse build server
  @main
  [ ] remove the -f option again - db formats shall be converted automatically
