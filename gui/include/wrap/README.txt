# wrap package

The wrap package contains classes to wrap the Gtk widgets.

In principle, Gtk widgety may be used and passed around gui classes without wrapper.

In cases where a small wrapper can avoid a dependency
from a class of this gui package towards the gtk package,
using a wrapper shall be considered.
