    To store a database in a version control system (vcs) like svn or git,
    store the json file format <command>*.cfuJ</command> to your vcs.

                Note that this feature requires at least version 1.35.0, better version 1.39.0 to work smoothly.

                Do not synchronize the file with your vcs while you modify it at the same time;
                save your changes first and re-open the json file afterwards.

                In case of merge conflicts in <command>*.cfuJ</command> files,
                note that uuid strings do uniquely identify all json objects.
                Relations between objects are defined by these uuid strings.
                In contrast to uuids, integer-id can be changed
                as long as they are unique among all objects of same type within the file.
