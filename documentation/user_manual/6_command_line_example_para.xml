To store a database in a version control system (vcs) like svn or git,
you have two options:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
        Store the binary database format <command>*.cfu1</command> to your vcs,
        lock the file while modifying it.
    </para>
    <para>
        Advantage is
        a) the simple usage and
        b) the option to view read-only files.
    </para>
    <para>
        Disadvantage is the lack of
        a) diff and merge of files,
        b) identify who changed which line when and with which commit message,
        c) concurrent modifications.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
        Store the json file format <command>*.cfuJ</command> to your vcs.
    </para>
    <para>
        Note that this feature requires at least version 1.35.0, better version 1.39.0 to work smoothly.
    </para>
    <para>
        Do not synchronize the file with your vcs while you modify it at the same time.
    </para>
    <para>
        In case of merge conflicts in <command>*.cfuJ</command> files,
        note that uuid strings do uniquely identify all json objects.
        Relations between objects are defined by these uuid strings.
        Integer-id can be changed
        as long as they are unique among all objects of same type within the file.
    </para>
