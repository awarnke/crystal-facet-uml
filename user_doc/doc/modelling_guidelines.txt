 *
 *  This page lists remarks on creating a software architecture and design document in general
 *  and it lists hints on getting along with the tool crystal_facet_uml.
 *
 *  As all tools, this program has its strengths and weaknesses.
 *  This page helps in making use of the strenghts.

 *
 *  \li Diagrams are organized as a tree: Start the root of the tree showing the major use cases/features of your software.
 *  \li At the second level of the tree, list the main areas to be modelled, e.g. context (problem space) of development,
 *      tools and dataflows of development (solution space), context (problem space) of operating environment,
 *      system in operating environment (solution space), design decisions.
 *  \li Put only few elements into each diagram. This increases understandability of the main purpuse of the diagram.
 *  \li Put further aspects of a topic into a separate diagram. Do not hesitate to copy an element from one diagram
 *      to the next. This is what crystal_facet_uml is good at: it keeps the model in sync.
