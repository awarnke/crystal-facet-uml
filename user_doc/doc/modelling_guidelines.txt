 *  \section cfu-modelling-intro Modelling Introduction
 *
 *  This page lists remarks on creating a software architecture and design document in general
 *  and it lists hints on getting along with the tool crystal_facet_uml.
 *
 *  As all tools, this program has its strengths and weaknesses.
 *  This page helps in making use of the strenghts.

 *
 *  - Diagrams are organized as a tree:
 *    - Start the root of the tree showing the major use cases/features of your software.
 *    - At the second level of the tree, list the main areas to be modelled, e.g.:
 *      - context (problem space) of development,
 *      - context (problem space) of operating environment, system boundary,
 *      - design decisions, alternatives, rationales
 *      - tools and dataflows of development (solution space),
 *      - system in operating environment (solution space).
 *      .
 *    .
 *  - Put only few elements into each diagram. This increases understandability of the main purpuse of the diagram.
 *  - Put further aspects of a topic into a separate diagram. Do not hesitate to copy an element from one diagram
 *    to the next. This is what crystal_facet_uml is good at: it keeps the model in sync.
 *  .
 *
 *  \section cfu-modelling-hints general hints on architecture documentation
 *
 *  - Distinguish things that are
 *    - given constraints (problem space),
 *    - decisions, chosen and rejected alternatives and
 *    - the designed solution
 *    .
 *  - Names of things are crucial: If the reader gets a wrong understanding by the name of an element, a hundred correct sentences
 *    of describing text cannot set this straight again.
 *  - Every design element needs a description, maybe a list of responsibilities: What shall this element do, what is it for?
 *    Names alone cannot explain a system part.
 *  - Things that are similar but not the same shall be different entities when modelling.
 *    E.g. The process in which an example application runs may
 *    be different from the storage location and may be different from the software-component.
 *    These are three things:
 *    Example_App_Process (Type: Node), Example_App_ObjectFile (Type:Artifact) and Example_App_SWComponent (Type:Component).
 *  .
