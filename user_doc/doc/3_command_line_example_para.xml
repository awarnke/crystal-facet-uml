To store a database in a version control system (vcs), you have several options:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
        Store the binary database format to your vcs,
        lock the file while modifying it.
        Advantage is the simple usage;
        disadvantage is the lack of control on
        a) diff and merge of files,
        b) who changed which line when and with which commit message,
        c) concurrent modifications.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
        Store the json export to your vcs,
        import it to an empty crystal-facet-uml database before modifying it;
        export it back to json after modification (and before any pull/merge/rebase action).
        Afterwards, one can
        a) merge and diff files,
        b) find out who to ask on which change.
        Disadvantage is that this feature requires version 1.35.0,
        some additional scripts for the import and export operations,
        consistency checks on the database after import.
