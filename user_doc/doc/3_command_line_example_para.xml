you have several options:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
        Store the binary database format <command>*.cfu1</command> to your vcs,
        lock the file while modifying it.
    </para>
    <para>
        Advantage is
        a) the simple usage and
        b) the option to view read-only files.
        Disadvantage is the lack of
        a) diff and merge of files,
        b) identify who changed which line when and with which commit message,
        c) concurrent modifications.
    </para>
