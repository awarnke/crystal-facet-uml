Rusty Shadow
=============

Goal
-----------

This small sub-project shall convert the c-code of crystal-facet-uml to rust.

The rust code shall have a structure and layout
that allows to drop the c code and continue development with the rust code.

Strategy
-----------

The strategy is to have a minimal transpiler that basically converts c-types and 
c-functions
and allows to improve either the c-code or the transformation steps till the result is satisfying.

While the goal is not yet achieved, the project continues to be developed in c.
