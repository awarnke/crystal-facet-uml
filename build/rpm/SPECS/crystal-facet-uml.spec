%description
crystal-facet-uml creates sysml/uml diagrams to document system and software architecture.
As software architect, you can create a set of diagrams describing
use-cases, requirements, structural views, behavioral and deployment views.
crystal-facet-uml keeps element names and element hierarchies consistent.
The tool exports diagrams in svg, pdf, ps and png formats
to be used in text processing systems like DocBook, html, LaTeX.
crystal-facet-uml exports the model to json and xmi format; json can also be imported.
The json-based data file can be stored to git, branched and merged together with your source code.
It runs on your local linux PC and is based on gtk (incl glib, gdk, cairo, pango) and sqlite.
