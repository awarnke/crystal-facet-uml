crystal-facet-uml
=============

<!-- What is it? -->
crystal-facet-uml creates sysml/uml diagrams to document system and software architecture.

Like a crystal shows different facets of the same thing, this application shows different views of the same system.

<!-- For Whom? What can one do with it? Why does it help? -->
As software architect, you create a set of diagrams describing
use-cases, requirements, structural views, behavioral and deployment views.

<!-- How does the tool solve the task? What is the data flow? Is it interoperable? input/output formats. required Environment? -->
These views show selected elements and their relationships.
crystal-facet-uml keeps element names and element hierarchies consistent.

This tool runs on your local PC.
It stores the model data in a json-based file
which can be stored in git, branched and merged together with your source code.
crystal-facet-uml exports diagrams in svg, pdf, ps and png formats
which can be used in text processing systems like DocBook, html, LaTeX.
