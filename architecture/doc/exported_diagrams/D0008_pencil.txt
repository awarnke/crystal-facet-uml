pencil    [D0008]
| This diagram shows the main classes in the pencil package.


pencil_diagram_maker    [C0032]
| - coordinates layouting and drawing of a diagram
  uses --> pencil_layouter    [R0023]
  uses --> pencil_xxx_painter    [R0024]


pencil_layouter    [C0033]
| - layouts multiple elements within the bounds of a diagram
| - layouting is implemented in two steps:
|     1) defining a grid which associates abstract ordering data to diagram coordinates and 
|     2) assigning elements to coordinates
  modifies --> pencil_input_data_layout    [R0022]
  asks for sizes --> pencil_xxx_painter    [R0034]
  --> pencil_xxx_layouter    [R0055]


pencil_xxx_layouter    [C0051]


pencil_xxx_painter    [C0034]
