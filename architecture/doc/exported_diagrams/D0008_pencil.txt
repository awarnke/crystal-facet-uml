pencil_diagram_maker                             [C0032]
| - coordinates layouting and drawing of a diagram
| - implements kind of front controller pattern: all requests from gui to pencil are addressed to the pencil_diagram_maker
  uses --> pencil_xxx_layouter                   [R0023]
  uses --> pencil_xxx_painter                    [R0024]


pencil_xxx_layouter                              [C0033]
| - layouts multiple elements within the bounds of a diagram
| - can convert abstract order-values to x/y coordinates and vice versa
  modifies --> pencil_layout_data                [R0022]
  asks for sizes --> pencil_xxx_painter          [R0034]


pencil_xxx_painter                               [C0034]
| - knows the bounding boxes of single elements
| - draws single graphical elements
  requires --> pencil_layout_data                [R0025]


pencil_input_data                                [C0035]
| - caches data from the database needed to draw a diagram


pencil_layout_data                               [C0036]
| - stores locations of layouted elements (in the current diagram)
  references --> pencil_input_data               [R0021]


pencil                                           [C0002]
| - renders diagrams to cairo drawing contexts
| - highlights uml-elements as requested by the gui module
