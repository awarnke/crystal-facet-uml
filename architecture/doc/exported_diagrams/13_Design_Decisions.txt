Design Decisions    [0013D]
| This diagram shows fundamental design decisions of the crystal_facet_uml architecture.


Persistent Data Storage    [0075C]
| The UML Model shall be stored persistently.


XML    [0074C]
| The database is stored in XML format.
|     pro: text based, fits to svn and git repositories
|     con: all data needs to fit to RAM (or complex data handling)
   --> Persistent Data Storage    [0094R]


Json    [0076C]
| The database is stored in Json format.
|     pro: text based, fits to svn and git repositories
|     con: all data needs to fit to RAM (or complex data handling)
   --> Persistent Data Storage    [0093R]


SQLite DB    [0077C]
| The database is stored in sqlite3 format.
|     pro: the database cares on handling big amounts of data
|     con: binary files are not suitable for git repositories
   --> Persistent Data Storage    [0091R]


SQLite is chosen    [0079C]
| Rationale: This alternative is most future-proof in case the database becomes large.
   --> SQLite DB    [0095R]


Key-Value Pairs    [0078C]
| The database is stored as key-value pairs.
|     pro: allows automatic merges by git and svn
|     con: all data needs to fit to RAM (or complex data handling)
   --> Persistent Data Storage    [0092R]
