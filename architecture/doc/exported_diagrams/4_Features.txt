Features
| This diagram lists the main features of crystal facet uml.


Draw Diagrams
   --> Show Classifiers


Show multiple instances in same diagram
| One and the same classifier can be shown in a diagram multiple times (either as class/type or as instance)


Show Classifiers
| Classifiers are drawn to diagrams
| one classifier is visible in one or multiple diagrams
   --> Show multiple instances in same diagram
   --> Mark Classifiers
   --> Classifier has relations


Classifier is implicit instance
| A classifier can represent an anonymous (implicit) instance without defining an explicit instance relation


Diagrams are hierarchical
| There is one root diagram. All other diagrams shall have a parent diagram.
  <<extends>> --> Draw Diagrams


Classifier is explicit instance
| A classifier can be an explicitly modelled instance of another classifier


Classifier has relations
| A classifier can have zero, one or many relations; these may be of one or of differnet types.
| Circular dependencies may be forbidden if semantics undefined.

   --> Classifier is contained (child)


Mark Classifiers
| A classifier can be highlighted in one or several diagrams.
| The highlighting may be different in different diagrams where the classifier is shown.

Classifier is contained (child)
| A Classifier can either exist stand-alone or be a sub-element of another classifier.
