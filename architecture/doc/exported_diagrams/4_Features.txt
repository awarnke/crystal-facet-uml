   --> Show Classifiers    [0057R]


Show multiple instances in same diagram    [0011C]
| One and the same classifier can be shown in a diagram multiple times (either as class/type or as instance)


Show Classifiers    [0009C]
| Classifiers are drawn to diagrams
| one classifier is visible in one or multiple diagrams
   --> Show multiple instances in same diagram    [0058R]
   --> Mark Classifiers    [0061R]
   --> Classifier has relations    [0062R]


Classifier is implicit instance    [0015C]
| A classifier can represent an anonymous (implicit) instance without defining an explicit instance relation


Diagrams are hierarchical    [0016C]
| There is one root diagram. All other diagrams shall have a parent diagram.

Classifier is explicit instance    [0014C]
| A classifier can be an explicitly modelled instance of another classifier


Classifier has relations    [0012C]
| A classifier can have zero, one or many relations; these may be of one or of differnet types.
| Circular dependencies may be forbidden if semantics undefined.

Mark Classifiers    [0013C]
| A classifier can be highlighted in one or several diagrams.
| The highlighting may be different in different diagrams where the classifier is shown.

Classifier is contained (child)    [0010C]
| A Classifier can either exist stand-alone or be a sub-element of another classifier.
