Features:
This diagram lists the main features of crystal facet uml.

Classifier has relations:
A classifier can have zero, one or many relations; these may be of one or of differnet types.
Circular dependencies may be forbidden if semantics undefined.

Classifier is marked:
A classifier can be highlighted in one or several diagrams.
The highlighting may be different in different diagrams where the classifier is shown.

Classifier is contained (child):
A Classifier can either exist stand-alone or be a sub-element of another classifier.

Diagrams are hierarchical:
There is one root diagram. All other diagrams shall have a parent diagram.

Classifier is implicit instance:
A classifier can represent an anonymous (implicit) instance without defining an explicit instance relation

Classifier is shown:
Classifiers are drawn to diagrams
one classifier is visible in one or multiple diagrams

Classifier is explicit instance:
A classifier can be an explicitly modelled instance of another classifier

Multiple instances of a classifier are shown:
One and the same classifier can be shown in a diagram multiple times (either as class/type or as instance)
