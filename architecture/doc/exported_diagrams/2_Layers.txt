Layers:
This diagram shows the layering of the main software modules.

gui:
- allows a user 
    - to select the database
    - to export diagrams
    - to modify the uml-model

pencil:
- renders diagrams to cairo drawing contexts
- highlights uml-elements as requested by the gui module

ctrl:
- provides write access to the database
- ensures consistency of the uml-model, e.g. no duplicate object names, no circular contains-relations

data:
- provides read access to ctrl, pencil and gui components
- provides write acccess to only the ctrl component
- ensures low-level consistency of database: all referenced objects exist.
- sends notifications on changes
