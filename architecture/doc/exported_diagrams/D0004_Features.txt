Features    [D0004]
| This diagram lists the main features of crystal facet uml.


Draw Diagrams    [C0031]
  --> Show Classifiers    [R0057]


Show multiple instances in same diagram    [C0011]
| One and the same classifier can be shown in a diagram multiple times (either as class/type or as instance)


Show Classifiers    [C0009]
| Classifiers are drawn to diagrams
| one classifier is visible in one or multiple diagrams
  --> Show multiple instances in same diagram    [R0058]
  --> Mark Classifiers    [R0061]
  --> Classifier has relations    [R0062]


Classifier is implicit instance    [C0015]
| A classifier can represent an anonymous (implicit) instance without defining an explicit instance relation


Diagrams are hierarchical    [C0016]
| There is one root diagram. All other diagrams shall have a parent diagram.
  <<extends>> --> Draw Diagrams    [R0014]


Classifier is explicit instance    [C0014]
| A classifier can be an explicitly modelled instance of another classifier


Classifier has relations    [C0012]
| A classifier can have zero, one or many relations; these may be of one or of differnet types.
| Circular dependencies may be forbidden if semantics undefined.

  --> Classifier is explicit instance    [R0060]
  --> Classifier is contained (child)    [R0063]


Mark Classifiers    [C0013]
| A classifier can be highlighted in one or several diagrams.
| The highlighting may be different in different diagrams where the classifier is shown.

Classifier is contained (child)    [C0010]
| A Classifier can either exist stand-alone or be a sub-element of another classifier.
