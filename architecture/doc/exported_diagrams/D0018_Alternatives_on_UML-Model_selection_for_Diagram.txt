Alternatives on UML-Model selection for Diagram    [D0018]


Classifier or Relationship selection def. view    [C0092]
| Depending on the diagram type, either classifiers determine what is visble or relationships determine what is visible.
|     pro: similar concept for diagrams that show options/alternatives/scenarios to diagrams that show invariants.
|     con: Bigger extension to existing structure in version 1.0.0
|          Algorithm to distinguish used from unused elements gets complicated

Classifier selection defines view    [C0090]
| Diagramelements define which classifiers are visible in which diagram.
| All features of a visible classifier are shown.
| All relationships are shown that have visible classifiers at both ends.
|     pro: simple selection rule
|     con: Problematic for diagrams that show possible scenarios and alternatives (e.g sequences).
|          This solution assumes that the model is invariant for all diagrams.

Diagram shows Selection of UML-Model    [C0087]
| Each diagram shows selected parts of the UML-Model. How to select the parts?

Diagrams have filters    [C0096]
| Either diagrams filter ranges of x-order/y-order/list-order
| or diagrams filter by use-case (which requires that all relations belong to a use-case)
|     pro: small changes to existing database structure only
|     con: Unclear gui concept: How to make this filtering transparent to the user?
|          How to copy/paste between diagrams? How to make invisible relationships visible?
