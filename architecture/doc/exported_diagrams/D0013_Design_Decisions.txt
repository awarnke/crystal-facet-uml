Design Decisions    [D0013]
| This diagram shows fundamental design decisions of the crystal_facet_uml architecture.


Persistent Data Storage    [C0075]
| The UML Model shall be stored persistently.


XML    [C0074]
| The database is stored in XML format.
|     pro: text based, fits to svn and git repositories
|     con: all data needs to fit to RAM (or complex data handling)
   --> Persistent Data Storage    [R0094]


Json    [C0076]
| The database is stored in Json format.
|     pro: text based, fits to svn and git repositories
|     con: all data needs to fit to RAM (or complex data handling)
   --> Persistent Data Storage    [R0093]


SQLite DB    [C0077]
| The database is stored in sqlite3 format.
|     pro: the database cares on handling big amounts of data
|     con: binary files are not suitable for git repositories
   --> Persistent Data Storage    [R0091]


SQLite is chosen    [C0079]
| Rationale: This alternative is most future-proof in case the database becomes large.
   --> SQLite DB    [R0095]


Key-Value Pairs    [C0078]
| The database is stored as key-value pairs.
|     pro: allows automatic merges by git and svn
|     con: all data needs to fit to RAM (or complex data handling)
   --> Persistent Data Storage    [R0092]
