Details on Classifier Selected View              [D0021]
| The simple solution is to not implement special mechanisms
| for scenario-based diagrams
| but to require that all shown classifiers in a 
| scenario based diagram are explicit instances
| of the model-class.


Classifier selection defines view                [C0090]
| Diagramelements define which classifiers are visible in which diagram.
| All features of a visible classifier are shown.
| All relationships are shown that have visible classifiers at both ends.
|     pro: simple selection rule
|     con: Problematic for diagrams that show possible scenarios and alternatives (e.g sequences).
|          This solution assumes that the model is invariant for all diagrams,
|         therefore all diagrams showing examples/scenarios have to show own instances of classes,
|         not generic classes that are used in other diagrams.
