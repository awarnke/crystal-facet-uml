Utilities    [D0006]
| This diagram shows small utility modules.


main    [C0021]
| - starts the software
| - evaluates command line parameters
  --> main.c    [R0090]


trace    [C0020]
| - provides trace macros
| - traces allow to reconstruct/follow the program flow
  --> Info    [R0088]
  --> Timestamp    [R0089]
  --> End (function)    [R0087]
  --> Begin (function)    [R0086]


Begin (function)    [C0069]


Info    [C0071]


main.c    [C0073]


End (function)    [C0070]


Timestamp    [C0072]


universal    [C0030]
| provides small, generic utility classes that are independant of the project
  --> Bool List    [R0069]
  --> Array Index Sorter    [R0070]
  --> Int Pair    [R0068]


Array Index Sorter    [C0058]


Error    [C0052]
| An error is a condition that leads to an observalbe malfunction.


Event    [C0055]
|  An event is a signal that is send to or received from external software parts.


Int Pair    [C0056]


Bool List    [C0057]


Warning    [C0053]
| A warning is issued when a condition may possibly lead to a malfunction.


Anomaly    [C0054]
| An anomaly is a condition that is expected to not cause a malfunction but that should be logged to easier analyze issues.


tslog    [C0019]
| - provides macros for event-logging and error-logging
| - macros are typesafe (ts) so that integers are not acidentially passed to char* parameters
  --> Error    [R0064]
  --> Anomaly    [R0066]
  --> Event    [R0067]
  --> Warning    [R0065]
