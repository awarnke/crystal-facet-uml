| This diagram shows small utility modules.


tslog                                            [C0019]
| - provides macros for event-logging and error-logging
| - macros are typesafe (ts) so that integers are not acidentially passed to char* parameters
  --> Error                                      [R0064]
  --> Anomaly                                    [R0066]

trace                                            [C0020]
| - provides trace macros
| - traces allow to reconstruct/follow the program flow

  --> Begin (function)                           [R0086]


main                                             [C0021]
| - starts the software
| - evaluates command line parameters
  --> main.c                                     [R0090]


universal                                        [C0030]
| provides small, generic utility classes that are independant of the project
  --> Bool List                                  [R0069]
  --> Array Index Sorter                         [R0070]
  --> Int Pair                                   [R0068]


Error                                            [C0052]
| An error is a condition that leads to an observalbe malfunction.


Warning                                          [C0053]
| A warning is issued when a condition may possibly lead to a malfunction.


Anomaly                                          [C0054]
| An anomaly is a condition that is expected to not cause a malfunction but that should be logged to easier analyze issues.


Event                                            [C0055]
|  An event is a signal that is send to or received from external software parts.
