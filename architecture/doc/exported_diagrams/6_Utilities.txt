Utilities    [0006D]
| This diagram shows small utility modules.


main    [0021C]
| - starts the software
| - evaluates command line parameters
   --> main    [0090R]


trace    [0020C]
| - provides trace macros
| - traces allow to reconstruct/follow the program flow
   --> Info    [0088R]
   --> Timestamp    [0089R]
   --> End (function)    [0087R]
   --> Begin (function)    [0086R]


Begin (function)    [0069C]


Info    [0071C]


main    [0073C]


End (function)    [0070C]


Timestamp    [0072C]


universal    [0030C]
| provides small, generic utility classes that are independant of the project
   --> Bool List    [0069R]
   --> Array Index Sorter    [0070R]
   --> Int Pair    [0068R]


Array Index Sorter    [0058C]


Error    [0052C]
| An error is a condition that leads to an observalbe malfunction.


Event    [0055C]
|  An event is a signal that is send to or received from external software parts.


Int Pair    [0056C]


Bool List    [0057C]


Warning    [0053C]
| A warning is issued when a condition may possibly lead to a malfunction.


Anomaly    [0054C]
| An anomaly is a condition that is expected to not cause a malfunction but that should be logged to easier analyze issues.


tslog    [0019C]
| - provides macros for event-logging and error-logging
| - macros are typesafe (ts) so that integers are not acidentially passed to char* parameters
   --> Error    [0064R]
   --> Anomaly    [0066R]
   --> Event    [0067R]
   --> Warning    [0065R]
