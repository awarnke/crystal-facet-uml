pencil    [0008D]
| This diagram shows the main classes in the pencil package.


pencil_diagram_maker    [0032C]
| - coordinates layouting and drawing of a diagram
  uses --> pencil_layouter    [0023R]
  uses --> pencil_xxx_painter    [0024R]


pencil_layouter    [0033C]
| - layouts multiple elements within the bounds of a diagram
| - layouting is implemented in two steps:
|     1) defining a grid which associates abstract ordering data to diagram coordinates and 
|     2) assigning elements to coordinates
  modifies --> pencil_input_data_layout    [0022R]
  asks for sizes --> pencil_xxx_painter    [0034R]
