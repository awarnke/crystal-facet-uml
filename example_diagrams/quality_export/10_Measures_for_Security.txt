Measures for Security
| Functional safety and security are different goals 
| but have common mechanisms to support these.
| 
| The diagram is not meant to be complete,
| it just shows that technical mechanisms support quality goals.


Non-Repudiation


Cryptographic Signatures
  asymmetric
  shared key (symmetric)
  supports --> Authenticity
  may support --> Non-Repudiation
  support --> Secure Boot


Encryption
  symmetric
  public/private
  supports --> Confidentiality


Confidentiality


Secure Boot
   --> Integrity
   --> Authenticity


Authenticity


Over-the-Air Updates
  Security Updates in Time
  supports --> Integrity


Integrity


Least Priviledge
| Entities shall have only the access rights they need for their purpose
  supports --> Accountability


Accountability


Partitioning
  supports --> Integrity


Certificates
  chain of certificates
  use --> Cryptographic Signatures
  divide and manage --> Accountability


Groups
| Grouping Clients/Actors helps
| Grouping Services 
| helps in administration of access rights
  support --> Accountability


Network Partitioniong
  Network Zones (VLANs)
  Gateways/Firewalls/Proxies
  implements --> Partitioning


Inner-Node Partitions
  Hypervisor Partitions
  OS-Process Boundaries
  Microkernel OS for Driver Partitioning
  Containers (Linux,QNX-Partitions,Address-space)
  implements --> Partitioning
