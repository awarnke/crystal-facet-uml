Measures for Reliability


Layered Architecture
  improves --> Maturity


Coding Guidelines
  static thread model
  | Execution threads shall not be started/stopped dynamically
  no endless loops
  | Every loop shall have a counter to ensures that 
  | after a predefined maximum value the loop is definitely quit
  consistent error handling
  | Inconsistencies in error handling make 
  | bugs in error handling more likely
  valid Memory Addresses
  | Only valid memory addresses may be read/written.
  | E.g. Java solves this by prohibiting pointers
  no dynamic Memory
  no recursion: avoid Stack overflow
