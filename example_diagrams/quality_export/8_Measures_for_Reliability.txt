Measures for Reliability:


Layered Architecture:

  improves --> Maturity:


Coding Guidelines:

  static thread model:
  | Execution threads shall not be started/stopped dynamically

  no endless loops:
  | Every loop shall have a counter that ensures that after a predefined maximum value after the loop is quit

  consistent error handling:
  | Inconsistencies in error handling make code vulnerabile to bugs in error handling

  valid Memory Addresses:
  | Only valid memory addresses may be read/written.
  | E.g. Java solves this by prohibiting pointers

  no dynamic Memory:

  no recursion: avoid Stack overflow:
