| This diagram shows examples - not aiming for completeness.


Testability                                      [C0047]


Modifyability                                    [C0046]


Analyzability                                    [C0045]


Reusability                                      [C0044]


Modularity                                       [C0043]


Single Responsability                            [C0089]
| A software component shall be responsible for one topic only


Open/Closed                                      [C0090]
| Open for extension, closed for modification


Liskov Substitution                              [C0091]
| An implementation of an interface can be replaced 
| by another implementation of the same interface.
| In object oriented design, types can be replaced by subtypes.


Interface Segregation                            [C0092]
| Avoid general purpose interfaces, 
| design multiple interfaces specific to the needs of different users/clients


Dependency Inversion                             [C0093]
| A software component shall depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations
  use Abstractions                               [F0046]


KISS                                             [C0094]
| Keep it simple and stupid


YAGNI                                            [C0095]
| You aren't gonna need it

  Clear semantics of names                       [F0067]
  | Module names, Interface names, Message names, Port names:
  | The name shall state what the data/function represents.
  | The name shall be short and as concrete as possible.
