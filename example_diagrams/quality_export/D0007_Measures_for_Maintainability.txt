Reusability    [C0044]


KISS    [C0094]
| Keep it simple and stupid


Analyzability    [C0045]


YAGNI    [C0095]
| You aren't gonna need it


Occam's razor    [C0097]
| Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected


Modifyability    [C0046]


Information Hiding    [C0102]
| A sofware component shall hide its implementation details and 
| make information accessible only via defined interfaces
  enables --> Reusability    [R0115]
  supports --> Modularity    [R0116]
  simplifies --> Testability    [R0117]
  simplifies --> Analyzability    [R0118]


Single Responsability    [C0089]
| A software component shall be responsible for one topic only


SOLID    [C0096]
  --> Interface Segregation    [R0101]
  --> Liskov Substitution    [R0102]
  --> Dependency Inversion    [R0103]
  --> Open/Closed    [R0104]
  --> Single Responsability    [R0105]
  supports --> Modularity    [R0111]


Interface Segregation    [C0092]
| Avoid general purpose interfaces, 
| design multiple interfaces specific to the needs of different users/clients


Testability    [C0047]


Open/Closed    [C0090]
| Open for extension, closed for modification


Liskov Substitution    [C0091]
| An implementation of an interface can be replaced 
| by another implementation of the same interface.
| In object oriented design, types can be replaced by subtypes.


Dependency Inversion    [C0093]
| A software component shall depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations
  use Abstractions    [F0046]


Modularity    [C0043]


Least Astonishment    [C0103]
| A reader shall not be surprised when looking at the design.
  Conformity of style and concepts    [F0066]


Strong Cohesion    [C0104]
  influences --> Modularity    [R0119]


Loose Coupling    [C0101]
| split an entity that consists of multiple loosely coupled parts
  supports --> Modularity    [R0114]
