Reusability    [0044C]


KISS    [0094C]
| Keep it simple and stupid


Analyzability    [0045C]


YAGNI    [0095C]
| You aren't gonna need it


Occam's razor    [0097C]
| Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected


Modifyability    [0046C]


Information Hiding    [0102C]
| A sofware component shall hide its implementation details and make information accessible only via defined interfaces
  enables --> Reusability    [0115R]
  supports --> Modularity    [0116R]
  simplifies --> Testability    [0117R]
  simplifies --> Analyzability    [0118R]


Single Responsability    [0089C]
| A software component shall be responsible for one topic only


SOLID    [0096C]
   --> Interface Segregation    [0101R]
   --> Liskov Substitution    [0102R]
   --> Dependency Inversion    [0103R]
   --> Open/Closed    [0104R]
   --> Single Responsability    [0105R]
  supports --> Modularity    [0111R]


Interface Segregation    [0092C]
| Avoid general purpose interfaces, design multiple interfaces specific to the needs of different users/clients


Testability    [0047C]


Open/Closed    [0090C]
| Open for extension, closed for modification


Liskov Substitution    [0091C]
| An implementation of an interface can be replaced by another implementation of the same interface. In object oriented design, types can be replaced by subtypes.


Dependency Inversion    [0093C]
| A software component shall depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations
  use Abstractions    [0046F]


Modularity    [0043C]


Least Astonishment    [0103C]
| If a reader is astonished when looking at the design, a redesign shall be considered.
| Measure: Conformity of style and concepts


Strong Cohesion    [0104C]
  influences --> Modularity    [0119R]


Loose Coupling    [0101C]
| split an entity that consists of multiple loosely coupled parts
  supports --> Modularity    [0114R]
