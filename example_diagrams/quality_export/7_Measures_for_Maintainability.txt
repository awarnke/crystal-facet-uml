Measures for Maintainability


Simplicity
   --> KISS
   --> YAGNI
   --> Occam's razor
  supports --> Modifyability
  supports --> Reusability


Reusability


KISS
| Keep it simple and stupid


Analyzability


YAGNI
| You aren't gonna need it


Occam's razor
| Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected


Modifyability


SOLID
   --> Interface Segregation
   --> Liskov Substitution
   --> Dependency Inversion
   --> Open/Closed
   --> Single Responsability
  supports --> Modularity


Information Hiding
| A sofware component shall hide its implementation details and make information accessible only via defined interfaces
  enables --> Reusability
  supports --> Modularity
  simplifies --> Testability
  simplifies --> Analyzability


Single Responsability
| A software component shall be responsible for one topic only


Interface Segregation
| Avoid general purpose interfaces, design multiple interfaces specific to the needs of different users/clients


Testability


Open/Closed
| Open for extension, closed for modification


Liskov Substitution
| An implementation of an interface can be replaced by another implementation of the same interface. In object oriented design, types can be replaced by subtypes.


Dependency Inversion
| A software component shall depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations
  use Abstractions


Modularity


Least Astonishment
| If a reader is astonished when looking at the design, a redesign shall be considered.
| Measure: Conformity of style and concepts


Strong Cohesion
  influences --> Modularity


Loose Coupling
| split an entity that consists of multiple loosely coupled parts
  supports --> Modularity
